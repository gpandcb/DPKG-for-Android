DPKG for Android
For the DPKG README see README.dpkg

Notes for compiling:

The Android NDK is lacking a number of header files which need to be placed in the $ANDROID_ROOT/platforms/android-3/arch-arm/usr/include/ folder before this will compile. These header files can taken from any 32-bit linux installation. This includes (with the above path prefix):
/sys/termios.h
/sys/fcntl.h
/sys/poll.h
/sys/types.h

I may have forgotten some, but they are easy to track down (look for unindentified structs), look them up and drop me a message so I can adjust this README.

Instructions for compiling:
Modify the android_configure file to point to your Android NDK installation.
Configure the installation by running ./android_configure
Finally start the build as normal by running make
